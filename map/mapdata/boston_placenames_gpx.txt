  Coordinate system/projection
  ----------------------------
  All data distributed by MassGIS are registered to the NAD83 datum,
  Massachusetts State Plane Mainland Zone coordinate system. Units are in
  meters. The data in the GPX file are registered to the NAD83 datum
  with angle units in degrees.
 
  Data set construction
  ---------------------
  This file was constructed using MATLAB and Mapping Toolbox.
  This data set was constructed from the boston_placenames.shp shapefile.
  The projected coordinates were inverse projected to create 
  latitude and longitude coordinates, using the following code:

   S = shaperead('boston_placenames');
   proj = geotiffinfo('boston.tif');
   surveyFeetPerMeter = unitsratio('sf','meter');
    for k=1:numel(S)
        x =  surveyFeetPerMeter * S(k).X;
        y =  surveyFeetPerMeter * S(k).Y;
        [S(k).Lat, S(k).Lon] = projinv(proj, x, y);
    end
    S = rmfield(S, {'X','Y','Geometry'});
    p = geopoint(S);
    p.Name = p.NAME;
    p.Description = p.FEATURE;
    p = rmfield(p, {'NAME', 'FEATURE', 'COORD'});
    p.Metadata.FeatureType = 'waypoint';

  The geopoint, p, was written to the file, boston_placenames.gpx.

  Data Attributes
  ---------------
  The Name attribute represents place names for geographic features.

  The Description attribute specifies a feature type. Feature types come from 
  three categories:
  
      * hydrographic features - lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, bays, harbors,
      * channels
      * civic features - city and town names, sections, villages
      * hypsographic features - hills, mountains, points, beaches,
      * islands

  Waypoints
  ---------
  This data set contains 13 waypoints.

  Tracks
  ------
  This data set contains 0 tracks.

  Routes
  ------
  This data set contains 0 routes.
