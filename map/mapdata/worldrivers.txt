Low-resolution vectors representing major rivers of the world, stored as
lines in shapefile format with coordinates in latitude (Y) and longitude
(X) in degrees.  A 'Name' attribute provides names for most rivers.  The
coordinate sampling is equivalent to a scale of 1:30,000,000.  This data
set is suitable for global displays.

The raw coordinate data were derived from the Digital Chart of the World
(DCW) browser layer ('Streams, rivers, channelized rivers'), published by
U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly National
Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).
