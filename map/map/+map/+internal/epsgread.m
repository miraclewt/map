function result = epsgread(table, code)
%epsgread Read table or record from EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset
%
%   RESULT = EPSGREAD(TABLE) reads all records and fields from the
%   designated table, returning the results in a 2-D cell array of strings,
%   with the field names in its top row. TABLE is a string containing the
%   name of the EPSG table to be read, minus the '.csv' file extension. The
%   result can be viewed in tabular form using the workspace browser.
%
%   RECORD = EPSGREAD(TABLE,CODE) reads the record that matches the
%   specified numeric code and returns its contents in a scalar structure
%   in which the field names match the strings in the table header. RECORD
%   is [] if no match for the code is found.
%
%   CODES = EPSGREAD(TABLE,'codes') returns a numeric column vector
%   listing the integer codes from the first column of the table.
%
%   Limitations
%   -----------
%   The function assumes that the only newline characters are record
%   delimiters.  But the files 'coordinate_operation_method.csv' and
%   'change.csv' have rows with embedded newlines, so they cannot be read.
%
%   The function does not handle empty files gracefully, and hence cannot
%   read the 'codes' table.
%
%   Examples
%   --------
%   % Read the entire ellipsoid table into a 2-D cell array 
%   % and view it in the variable editor.
%   result = map.internal.epsgread('ellipsoid'); openvar result
%
%   % Read a single record from the ellipsoid table into a scalar struct.
%   result = map.internal.epsgread('ellipsoid',7019)
%
%   % Read a single record from the unit of measure table into a
%   % scalar struct.
%   result = map.internal.epsgread('unit_of_measure',9001)
%
%   % Read the numeric codes from the unit of measure table
%   % into a column vector.
%   codes = map.internal.epsgread('unit_of_measure','codes')

%parseCSV Parse a data line from a comma-separate-value (CSV) file

%   vector of strings, DATA, with one element for each comma-separated
%   field/data element found in TLINE.
%
%   Remarks
%   -------
%   (1) Even though the TLINE should have come from a "CSV" file, not all
%       commas are separators. Some fields begin and end with a quotation
%       mark, and these fields may contain commas that are just part of the
%       text.
%
%   (2) True quoted text, as in the name of a source work such as
%       "Geodetic Reference System 1980", is enclosed in pairs of doubled
%       quotation marks, like this: ""Geodetic Reference System 1980"".
%
%   (3) It's important to remove the quotation marks of the sort mentioned
%       in remark (1), and to eliminate the extra quotation marks in the
%       case of remark (2); parseCSV performs both these operations.

% Special characters
comma = char(44);
quote = char(34);
newline = char(10);

% Append a comma-separator to the end of the line.
tline(end+1) = comma;

% For comma-quotation and quotation-comma pairs that might begin and end
% fields, identify the location of the comma in each pair.
sQuote = strfind(tline,[comma quote]) + 1;
eQuote = strfind(tline,[quote comma]);

if ~isempty(sQuote) && ~isempty(eQuote)
    % Eliminate false positives in sQuote and eQuote by ensuring that they
    % occur in alternating pairs. Start by combining them, then sorting.
    % Apply the sort index to a vector of 0s and 1s in which 0 indicates
    % the occurrence of a comma-quotation pair and 1 indicates the
    % occurrence of a quotation-comma pair. Use diff to identify the places
    % where runs of multiple comma-quotation pairs start and where runs of
    % multiple quotation-comma pairs end. All other elements in such runs
    % are false positives and will be removed.
    aQuote = [sQuote eQuote];
    [aQuote, ix] = sort(aQuote);
    r = [zeros(size(sQuote)) ones(size(eQuote))];
    r = r(1,ix);         % Logical index to ending elements within aQuote
    q = ~r(1,end:-1:1);  % Logical index to starting elements within aQuote, flipped LR
    q = diff([q 0]);
    q = q(1,end:-1:1) == -1;  % Index to starting elements minus false positives
    r = diff([r 0])   == -1;  % Index to ending elements minus false positives
    sQuote = aQuote(q);  % sQuote with false positives removed
    eQuote = aQuote(r);  % eQuote with false positives removed
    
    % Identify the elements of TLINE that are bounded by comma-quotation /
    % quotation-comma pairs (after excluding false positives). Construct
    % vectors s and e that are zero except where the commas in such pairs
    % are located. The cumulative sums of s and e, when added together,
    % will be even for sections of TLINE that are not so bounded, and odd
    % for sections of TLINE that are.
    s = zeros(size(tline));
    e = zeros(size(tline));
    s(sQuote + 1) = 1;
    e(eQuote) = 1;
    boundedByCommaQuoteQuoteComma = (mod(cumsum(s) + cumsum(e),2) == 1);
else
    boundedByCommaQuoteQuoteComma = false(size(tline));

isComma = (tline == comma);

% A separating comma is any element of TLINE that is a comma and (a) is not
